                    <p>
                        This Cookie Policy explains how Rachel Aronne Yoga (&quot;Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, and &quot;our&quot;) uses 
                        cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites at
                        <Link href="https://rachelaronneyoga.com/">
                            &nbsp;https://rachelaronneyoga.com</Link>, (&quot;Websites&quot;). 
                        It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, 
                        as well as your rights to control our use of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, 
                        or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device 
                        when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners 
                        in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, 
                        as well as to provide reporting information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Rachel Aronne Yoga) 
                        are called &quot;first party cookies&quot;. 
                        Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called 
                        &quot;third party cookies&quot;. Third party cookies enable third party 
                        features or functionality to be provided on or through the website 
                        (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). 
                        The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your 
                        computer both when it visits the website in question and also when 
                        it visits certain other websites.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. 
                        Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our 
                        Websites to operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;strictly 
                        necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests 
                        of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve 
                        cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. 
                        This is described in more detail below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The specific types of first and third party cookies served 
                        through our Websites and the purposes they perform are 
                        described below (please note that the specific cookies served 
                        may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):
                        <ul>
                            <li>Google Analytics</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You may set or amend your web browser 
                        controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can 
                        refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, 
                        you should visit your browser&apos;s help menu for more information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt 
                        out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, 
                        please visit&nbsp;

                    <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors 
                        to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, 
                        like web beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or &quot;clear gifs&quot;). 
                        These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable 
                        us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. 
                        This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one 
                        page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to 
                        understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement 
                        displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure 
                        the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies 
                        are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will 
                        impair their functioning.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Websites may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also known as 
                        Local Shared Objects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to, among other things, collect 
                        and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention 
                        and for other site operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can 
                        adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies 
                        storage using the tools contained in the&nbsp;

                            You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the&nbsp;

                            and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, 
                            for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies 
                            (referred to &quot;information&quot; on the Macromedia site), 
                            how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer 
                            without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) 
                            how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the 
                            operator of the page you are on at the time).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict 
                        or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede 
                        the functionality of some Flash applications, including, 
                        potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.

                    <h3>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve 
                        advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about 
                        your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements 
                        about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology 
                        that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by 
                        them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and 
                        other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of 
                        potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not 
                        enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that 
                        directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
